## Description
People may assume the frontend of a website is the most important because that is what the user sees but without a backend you cannot have a functioning website. Buidling out this backend allow you to get all, get one, create, update, and delete a product, tag, or category. By building these routes it makes it possible to easily manipulate the data. During this I got a better grasp of building out a backend and I got to utilize skills and techniques that I have recently learned.

## Usage
To use any of the routes you will first need to do a npm install to download the necessary packages. Then you can open mysql to run the schema followed by running the seed. After that you can run node server.js. This will make the server listen to adjust the data to what you input.
